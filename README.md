# ErUMData - Active Training Course 2023

Tutorials and lectures for advanced deep Learning methods hosted by the ErUM-Data-Hub [https://indico.desy.de/event/37478/]

Tutorials originally created for the Deep Learning in Particle Physics course, spring semester 2022, at the University of Heidelberg. These tutorials were produced and delivered by Barry Dillon with the help of PhD students at the university:  Luigi Favaro, Theo Heimel, and Michel Luchmann. They were modified and shortened for this course.

The physics datasets used for these tutorials were slightly too big to put here, but they can be downloaded by
executing

```sh
# get into directory and executre
cd datasets
python get_data.py
```

or directly download it here:

and move it into the `datasets` folder.
